Unit 1 Health Matters

Lesson 1: Accidents

Vocabulary Tip 1: Word sets
- A good way to learn new words is to put connected words in sets:
Fruit: apples oranges grapes bananas strawberries

A Study the Vocabulary Tip, then, using a dictionary, check the meaning of any words you don’t know. Write the words below in the correct set. There are five words in each set.

ankle bandage blood bones breathe cough cream elbow faint heart knee medicine plaster pills shoulder skin sneeze stomach swallow wrist

Set Words

Treatment: bandage

Joints: ankle

Verbs: breathe

Inside and outside the body: blood bones

B Work in pairs. Student A chooses one of the problems a to n on pages 8 and 9 of the Course Book, but doesn’t tell Student B. Student A mimes the problem and Student B guesses what’s wrong and gives advice.

Example: Student A licks his lips and touches them.
- What’s the matter? Are your lips sore?
- Yes. And they’re really dry.
- You shouldn’t touch them. It will make them worse. You should put cream on them.

Vocabulary Tip 2: Word groups

• Words with similar meanings are not always interchangeable. It is easier to use a word correctly if you know whether it is a verb, a noun or an adjective. Be careful with these words: hurt, sore, pain.
• Hurt is a verb. The past simple is also hurt.
  My back hurts today. It also hurt yesterday. My feet hurt today. They hurt yesterday as well.
• Sore is an adjective.
  My back is sore. My feet are also sore. They weren't sore yesterday.
• Pain is a noun. In the singular it usually has an article.
  I have a pain in my stomach. Have you taken any medication for the pain?
  Yes, I took some painkillers an hour ago. Do you have pains anywhere else?

C Complete each sentence with a word from the box.
bleeding   broken   hurts   pain   sick   sore   dizzy   sneeze

1 'Have you got a cold?' 'No, I always ____________ when I put pepper on my food.'
2 He was ____________ three times in the night. I think the food at the restaurant where he ate wasn't very fresh.
3 She cut her hand while she was chopping vegetables. It was a very deep cut and it was ____________ a lot, so she had to go to hospital and have it stitched.
4 My back ____________ all the time. It only feels OK when I am lying down.
5 She can't play tennis. She has ____________ her right arm.
6 I went swimming yesterday and now my eyes are ____________ from the chemicals in the pool.
7 Where exactly is the ____________ and how long have you had it?
8 It was a very hot day and she hadn't eaten or drunk anything all day. That's why she suddenly went pale and felt ____________ during the lesson.

D Listen and choose the correct word to end each sentence. Write the numbers 1 to 6 in the correct boxes.
a burnt □   c swallow □   e temperature □
b fractured □   d swollen □   f throat □

Lesson 2: At the Hospital

Describing instances in the past: Using while, as and when to talk about past actions

- We can use the past continuous and the past simple in the same sentence to show that one action happened in the middle of another action. We use the past continuous for the longer action and the past simple for the shorter action.
  I was riding my bicycle and I fell over.

- We often use while and as with the past continuous tense.
  While I was eating breakfast, a bird flew into the kitchen.
  As I was eating breakfast, a bird flew into the kitchen.

- We often use when or and with the past simple tense.
  I was eating breakfast when a bird flew into the kitchen.
  I was eating breakfast and a bird flew into the kitchen.

‘The government should ban smoking in all public places.’ Write 100 to 120 words on this topic. Use the following notes to help you. Make sure you link your ideas and sentences.

• Introduction: Smoking is a dangerous habit – causes many deaths a year (from smoking-related diseases)
• Passive smoking (= breathing in smoke from people who are smoking near you) also causes disease, especially in children
• Non-smokers would prefer a smoke-free environment
• Adults smoking in public sets a bad example to children and teenagers
• Making life harder for smokers would make them give up
• Conclusion: A ban would save lives and save the government lots of money in health costs

When you have finished your draft, swap with a partner and give feedback on each other’s drafts. Use the rubric provided.

Lesson 5: Military Jobs

C21 SKILLS

A Look at the words in bold in the text on page 25 of the Course Book and try to guess their meaning. Check your ideas in a dictionary.

1 branches
2 join
3 install
4 maintain
5 officer
6 supervise
7 civilian

Reading Tip: Identifying the main idea

The topic sentence usually contains the main idea of the paragraph.

B Study the Reading Tip then read the first paragraph of the text more carefully and look at the question in 1.

1 What is the main idea of the first paragraph?
   a The Air Force is more fun because you can pilot planes.
   b You can do many different things in the military.
   c You have to be 18 years old to join the military.

Look at choice a). The problem with this answer is that it doesn’t give information that is in the first paragraph. Some people may think that piloting a plane is fun, but this is not what the text says. It simply tells you that if you join the Air Force, you can work with aeroplanes and helicopters. So choice a) is incorrect.

Choice c) does repeat information that is found in the first paragraph, since the last sentence of the paragraph is You must be 18 years old to join. But if you look at the other sentences, you will see that they mostly deal with the different activities people can do in the military. The last sentence gives additional information that is not directly related to the activities that people can do in the military. So choice c) is incorrect.

Choice b) is the correct choice, since most of the sentences in the paragraph tell you about the variety of military jobs.

Lesson 6: A Robbery

Reading Tip: Skimming and scanning
• When you are looking for information in a text, you can save a lot of time if you use the right technique.
Two common techniques are skimming and scanning. Skimming means looking at the whole text quickly, without reading it in detail, to understand what the text is about. Scanning is letting your eyes go over the text quickly to search for specific information. Scanning is a good technique when you know what you are looking for.

A Scan the texts on page 26 of the Course Book, and circle the correct answer.

1 Who called the police?
   a Sue
   b Mr Smith
   c Mrs Smith

2 What woke Sue up?
   a the police
   b the telephone
   c a loud noise

3 Who saw the robber?
   a a witness
   b the police
   c Sue

B Read the texts more carefully and answer the questions.

1 Why are the police reminding homeowners to lock their doors and windows?

2 Why is Sue happy that the robber left before her father went downstairs?

3 How does Sue feel now?

4 Why is Sue upset that her father's computer was stolen?

5 Why is Sue’s father getting the window lock replaced?

Dear ___________________________,

I’m thinking of doing an English course at Birchwood International College this summer. I was wondering if you would like to join me. It would be much nicer to have a friend with me, although we would have to promise to only speak English to each other!

I was thinking of going for _______________ weeks in ___________________. Of course, it is never very hot in Britain, not even in the summer. So we wouldn’t need to worry about the heat.

There is a choice of 24 locations. The college has both country and city locations. Personally, I would prefer to be in __________________ because ________________________________, but of course, I don’t mind if you have a strong opinion about where you would like to go.
There is also a choice of accommodation. We can either stay ________________________________ or we can stay ________________________________.

Personally, I would prefer ________________________________ because ___________________________________________________________, but I am open to your suggestions.

The price of the course will be around £150 a week and the accommodation will cost around £75 a week. We will also need to take plenty of pocket money for shopping, _______________ and souvenirs. I definitely think it will be worth it even if it does cost a lot of money. We will learn _______________ and visit some wonderful places.

I really hope you can come. It will be a great experience. Let me know what you think.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Best wishes,

• Suggest the month when you’d like to go and how long you’d like to go for.
• Describe the choice of locations.
• Suggest the location you’d prefer. Give reasons for your preference. For example, in a city there will be more to do and lots of good shops and restaurants. Or, in a country location, there will be plenty of peace and quiet and the opportunity to get fit.
• Say you are open to suggestions about location.
• Suggest the type of accommodation you would prefer. Give reasons. For example, with a homestay you would get more chance to meet British people and speak English in the evenings.

Lesson 1: Travelling Abroad

A Complete the sentences with the compound nouns on page 51 of the Course Book.

1 If we get a ________________________ in Spain, we can buy food at the market and make our own meals.

2 Let’s not go on a ________________________ to Italy. It would be more fun to choose our own hotels and tours when we get there.

3 I can’t find my ________________________. I won’t be able to get on the plane if I don’t find it.

4 Let’s go for a walk along the ________________________ this evening and watch the sunset over the water.

5 I don’t like booking flights online. Let’s go and buy our tickets at that ________________________ in Al Saad Street.

6 If you order it now, the hotel kitchen will make a ________________________ for anyone who is going on the tour tomorrow.

7 I spent the morning at the beach and in the afternoon we did some ________________________. I took lots of photos of the Roman temples.

8 You can’t rely on public transport on that island. You should find out about ________________________ so you can travel more independently.

Vocabulary Tip: Compound nouns

- Compound nouns can be found in three different forms:
  • as in most of this exercise, where they are two separate nouns (or adjective + noun), e.g. footstep, bookshop.
  • those that are linked by a hyphen, e.g. horse-riding, singer-songwriter.
  • those that have become one word, e.g. armchair, teacup.

There is no clear rule about which form to use, and the form changes over time. When words are often used together, they might become hyphenated and later become one word.
Examples of two words becoming one are much more common than hyphenated words. For example, cardboard, footstep, lifestyle, sunset.

Talking about present actions that started in the past: Present perfect continuous

• We use the present perfect continuous to ask and answer about activities that began in the past and have just finished or are still going on now.
  How long have they been talking?
  How long have you been waiting?

• The present perfect continuous describes the same time period as the present perfect simple, so we use since and for with this tense as well.
  (They’ve been talking) for an hour/since eight o’clock.

For each situation, write questions using the words in brackets. Use the present perfect simple or present perfect continuous. Then write a suitable answer using since or for.

Example:
You arrive late for your appointment. You ask:
  (how long / wait?) How long have you been waiting?
  For ten minutes. / Since six o’clock.

1. You have a friend who is learning Japanese. You ask:
   (how long / learn / Japanese?)

2. You meet a pilot. You ask:
   (how long / be a pilot?)

Lesson 7: A Medical Tourist Destination

A Read the Functional Grammar box and think of four more examples.

Relative clauses: Giving more information

Defining relative clauses
Read the sentences and pay attention to the words in bold. Then match each sentence to the word that best describes what it is about. You will use one letter twice.
a ownership b people c places d things

The man who lives next door has just bought a private jet.
The bike which I borrowed yesterday is blue.
What have you done with the book that was on the table?
The laboratory where I work has very powerful computers.
The girl whose microscope I borrowed yesterday is called Layla.

Do the sentences give essential information or non-essential information?

Non-defining relative clauses
Non-defining relative clauses give a non-essential piece of information.
We use who for people, which for things and where for places. We cannot use that. We use whose to show possession.
When combining sentences to make a relative clause, there is incorporated into where, e.g., The University of ... is excellent. I studied English there. The University of ..., where I studied English, is excellent.

There is a comma (,) at the beginning of a non-defining relative clause, and a comma or a full stop at the end of it.

My father, who is interested in astronomy, buys two or three new books a month.
I lent the book to Saeed, who loves reading.
Misrata, which is about 200 kilometres east of Tripoli, is a popular tourist site.
The Galapagos, where I spent my last holiday, is famous for its wildlife conservation.
My brother, whose car was in an accident yesterday, is in hospital.

Writing Tip: Brainstorming ideas
It is sometimes difficult to think of ideas for an essay, particularly in an exam. One answer is to write down anything you can think of connected with the title, even unimportant things. This is called ‘brainstorming’. When you read the things you have written down, you will probably find some that you can use. Thinking of ideas quickly is really important, especially in an exam.

E C21 SKILLS
It is easier to think of ideas when you are in a group. Practise with the following essay title. One person should be the secretary and write down the ideas.

‘What would you recommend a visitor to do for a week in Libya?’

Think about these points:
• Which hotel in Tripoli? One with a good price? Good view? Good service?
• Some things to do in Tripoli: Libya’s National Museum: why? history of the country.
• Some things to do outside Benghazi: visit ruins in Cyrene.
• Something to do in Shahat: natural excursions.
• Something to do in the Libyan desert: visit Ghadames (the Pearl of the Desert).

Focusing on the action: Passive forms

• We use the passive form when the focus of the sentence is on the action.
This money was deposited last week.

• We can use by if we want to say who did the action.
The money was deposited last week by my uncle.

• The passive is often used to describe a process. However, it should not be overused.
When cash is withdrawn from an ATM, it is taken from your account.
The transaction is shown on your statement.

• To change from active to passive, we use to be + past participle. Note the tense change in the examples:
They are renovating the bank.
The bank is being renovated.
They sent the bank statement yesterday.
The bank statement was sent yesterday.
Your statement will show the withdrawal.
The cash withdrawal will be shown on your statement.
They have made three deposits into my account since last week.
Three deposits have been made into my account since last week.

النص المُستخرج من الصفحة : 
Conversation 1
Banker: Good morning, National Bank. Can I help you?
Customer: Yes, I don’t know what to do. I’ve lost my handbag. My wallet, with all my money and bank cards, was in it.
Banker: Are you sure you’ve lost it? Couldn’t you have just left it at home?
Customer: No. I definitely had it when I was at the café. I was talking to my friend when we left and I think I left it on the table.
Banker: Did you go back to look for it?
Customer: Yes, it wasn’t there. If I hadn’t been in such a hurry, I wouldn’t have left it there!
Banker: Don’t worry. If we cancel your cards now, no one else will be able to use them. New ones will be sent to you very soon.

Conversation 2
Customer: Do you take credit cards?
Cashier: I’m sorry, we don’t.
Customer: Can I pay by cheque?
Cashier: No, we only take cash.
Customer: I didn’t know that.
Cashier: Look, it’s on the sign.
Customer: Oh, no. If I’d known that, I would have brought cash.
Cashier: Well, if you go to the bank in the next street, you could get cash from the ATM.
Customer: Thank you very much.

Conversation 3
Waiter: I’m sorry, sir. Your credit card isn’t working.
Customer: Could you try it again, please? It worked yesterday.
Waiter: I’m sorry, it still isn’t working. Sometimes if you put in the wrong number several times, it gets blocked. Or you may have reached your credit limit. Would you like to pay by cheque instead?
Customer: Yes, that’s a good idea.

Customer: Good morning. Can you help me? My bank card didn’t come out of the ATM.
Banker: Of course. Can you give me your account number? I’ll check your account.
Customer: Yes, it’s 92671098. Does this mean there’s no money in my account?
Banker: No. If there was no money in your account, the machine would still give you your card back. I see the problem. Your card has expired.
Customer: It has?
Banker: Yes. Today is 5 April and your card was valid until 4 April. We sent you a new card two weeks ago.
Customer: I never received it.
Banker: We’ll cancel that one and send you a new one, then. You should receive it in three or four days.

B Find conditional sentences in the conversations. Read the Functional Grammar box and identify what type they are.

Talking about real or imaginary conditions and results: Types of conditional sentences

• There are four basic types of conditional sentences: zero, first, second and third.
We use:

| Conditional | Usage | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Zero        | To talk about something that is always true. | If you look at a computer screen for too long, your eyes get tired. |
| First       | To talk about the result of a possible action in the future. | If you send the parcel today, it will arrive on Thursday. |
| Second      | To talk about an action that depends on an imaginary present or future situation or action. | If I had a lot of money, I would buy a big boat. |
| Third       | When we talk about a desire to change something in the past. This is impossible as the actions are finished. | If I'd taken a taxi, I would have arrived on time. |

Note: Sometimes we can use could instead of would in conditional sentences.
• Conditional sentences have two parts: the if clause and the main conditional clause.
The order is not usually important, but when the if clause comes first, they are separated by a comma:
If I hadn’t been in such a hurry, I wouldn’t have left it there!
I wouldn’t have left it there if I hadn’t been in such a hurry!

Unit 7

Read the Study Tip about making inferences.

Reading Tip: Making inferences

As discussed in Unit 5, you often have to make inferences to answer questions. Making inferences involves understanding information that is not clearly stated in the text. You decide what makes sense based on the information you have in the text.

Although this may sound difficult, you do it all the time without realizing it. For example, if you read a sentence that says: Ahmed put his swimsuit and suncream in his bag, you can infer that Ahmed is going to the beach or outdoor pool.

What can you infer from the information in Paragraph 1?
a) A lot of people are looking for jobs or want to get a better job.
b) Many people are learning about computers for their pleasure.

It may be true that many people are learning about computers for their pleasure, but we don’t have any reason to infer this from the information in Paragraph 1, so the answer is not b).

But the sentence: Learning new computer skills can also help you change careers, and the number of people enrolling in computer classes is increasing, tells us that learning about computers can help you get a new job, and also that more and more people are taking computer classes. We can infer that these people want to get better jobs, so the answer is a).

Choose a or b to say which inference you can make from the article on page 77 of the Course Book. Underline the sentence or sentences that helped you decide.

Paragraph 2
a If you are a banker, you should learn to use spreadsheets.
b More and more teachers are learning to use spreadsheets.

Paragraph 2
a Web design is easy.
b More and more companies have websites.

Paragraph 3
a Students don’t have to take computer classes.
b Many universities offer classes for people who work.

You can be proud of your company.

Disadvantages
You have to work harder.

Student A puts the advantages and Student B the disadvantages. Use the points in Exercise B and add any extra ideas you think of during the conversation.

Lesson 7: Books and the Internet

A Read about opinion essays.

Writing Tip: Opinion essays
In an essay expressing opinion, you say what you think about a subject. But it isn't enough to say what you think, you also need to say why you think this. This makes your essay more convincing and interesting.

The essay begins with an introduction, and this usually mentions what you are going to write about in the main part of your essay.

The body of the essay gives more details and the reasons for your opinion. If there are two sides to a question, you can write about one side in one paragraph, and the other in the next paragraph.

In the conclusion you can sum up your ideas and your opinion.
