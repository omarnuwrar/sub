A Read the article and choose the best headline.
1 AIRBEDS CAN BE DANGEROUS!
2 WATCH OUT FOR RED SEA SHARKS!
3 DOLPHINS SAVED HIM FROM A SHARK!
4 FIRST AID ON THE BEACH!

It was a calm morning in the beautiful seaside town of Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Twenty-year-old Tariq Zaid, a tourist from Libya, was floating peacefully 150 metres from the shore when he felt something push him. 'I didn't know what it was,' he told reporters. 'I thought perhaps my airbed had hit a piece of wood. Then it pushed even harder and I fell into the water. That's when I saw it was a shark.'
He was trying to swim away when the shark bit his arm. Tariq, who was losing a lot of blood and thought he was about to die, screamed as loud as he could.
'I was praying to Allah to save me,' he said, 'when some dolphins swam up and frightened the shark away. There were at least six of them and they made a circle around me. The shark couldn't get near me.'

Coastguard Jamal Elalawi heard Tariq's screams and rescued him by boat. While he was giving Tariq first aid on the boat, his partner, Ahmed Al Masri, called the emergency services.
An ambulance was waiting for Tariq on the shore and he was immediately taken to the hospital at Sharm El Sheikh.
'It was the most frightening day of my life,' Tariq told reporters from his hospital bed. 'That shark wanted to have me for breakfast, but the dolphins saved me, thank Allah.'

B Now do Exercise A on page 12 of the Workbook.

C Read the Vocabulary Tip then find another example of a phrasal verb in the texts above.

Vocabulary Tip: Phrasal verbs

- Phrasal verbs are formed when a preposition (e.g., up/down/off) is added to a verb and creates a new verb (e.g., pick up/give up). Sometimes the new verb has a similar meaning, but sometimes it is very different.

I'll pick you up at half past seven. (= fairly similar to the verb pick)
He gave up smoking when he got ill. (= very different meaning from the verb give)

Lesson 7: Eating Healthily

A Complete the article with the correct linking words and phrases from the box.

As a result of this Finally, let's talk about Furthermore In my opinion In the past Let's start with Next, we need to look at Now The main reason is Yet

People should take responsibility for their own health
by Dr Samir Ramzi

EVERY YEAR, the government spends millions of pounds in health care on people who have brought their illnesses on themselves through bad diet, lack of exercise or smoking.
Let's start with 1 diet. In Britain, the number of diabetics goes up every year.
2 that people are eating food that contains too much fat, sugar and salt.
3 unhealthy diet, 60 per cent of British people are overweight and therefore at risk of becoming diabetic.

4 exercise. 5, people used to walk more, or use a bicycle to get around.
6 everyone gets in their car instead of walking, even if the distance is just a kilometre or two.

7, children spend hours playing TV and computer games instead of running about outside.
8 we all know that regular exercise helps us to control our weight and keep our heart healthy.

9 smoking. There's almost nothing that's worse for your health than this habit. Smoking damages the lungs and heart, and smokers generally need more medical attention than non-smokers.

10, the government should not give free health care to people who don't take care of themselves. People who lead unhealthy lives should pay for their own health care. And if they bring up their children in an unhealthy way, they should pay for their children's health care, too.

B Now do Exercise A on page 18 of the Workbook.

C Read the Writing Tip and underline any words and phrases you don't know.

Writing Tip: Linking words and phrases to state opinion, list points or talk about cases and results

A Read the article and choose the best title.
1 DIABETES, A DEADLY DISEASE
2 MODERN MEDICINE
3 SAVED BY HER 4-YEAR-OLD SON
4 HOW TELEPHONES SAVE LIVES

WHEN FOUR-YEAR-OLD Mustafa Ahmad woke up, he got straight out of bed and went to look for his mother. He was a little puzzled because she normally came into his room first thing in the morning, woke him up and helped him get dressed. He had no idea why she wasn’t there that sunny morning in April.

He went to look for her in the kitchen first. There was no sign of her there. And the bathroom was empty, too. Then he opened her bedroom door and saw that she was still asleep. He tried to wake her up by shaking her and calling, but to no avail. For some reason, he couldn’t wake her up.

Latifa, Mustafa’s mother, suffers from diabetes. This means she has to control her blood sugar with injections of insulin. But sometimes, the levels of sugar in her blood drop too low, and then she can lose consciousness. That is what had happened. During the night, Latifa’s blood sugar had dropped very low and she had lost consciousness. Without help, she could have died in a few hours.

Mustafa’s father was away on a business trip, so Mustafa was the only one who could help her. Mustafa knew that when his mother needed sugar quickly, she usually drank something sweet. So he went back to the kitchen and took a can of cola out of the fridge. He brought it back to his unconscious mother and tried to make her drink it. He couldn’t, of course, so after spilling quite a lot of the cola on the bed, he decided on another plan - to call the emergency services. Luckily, his grandmother had taught him how to do that just the previous week.

Emergency operator Ahmed Isa took the call. ‘The little boy was very calm. He just said, “My mummy is sick. She needs a doctor.” I asked him for his address, and he told me.’

An ambulance arrived at the house fifteen minutes later. Mustafa had to stand on a chair to open the front door for the paramedics. They rushed upstairs, found Latifa unconscious and spotted her insulin user’s identity card. They knew at once that she was diabetic, and gave her an injection to raise her blood sugar level. Latifa regained consciousness very quickly. “I’ll always be proud of Mustafa,” Latifa says. “He was calm and intelligent when he needed to be. And that’s how he saved my life.”

Lesson 2: A Police Officer’s Duties

A. What does a police officer do? With a partner, list as many activities as you can think of in two minutes. Use the pictures to help you.

B. A police officer has given a talk to a school class about his job. As part of the talk, he gave out an information pack to the students. Read the extracts from the information pack below. What activities does he mention? How many are the same as your ideas?

1. People have to follow the law so that we can all live together safely. There are a lot of different laws, so police officers have a lot of different duties. Some officers direct traffic to make sure that drivers can use the roads easily and without having accidents. They also use radar speed guns to identify people who are driving too fast. This is very important. Drivers mustn't speed because speeding is one of the leading causes of death on the road. Police officers also check that drivers and passengers are wearing their seat belts. Some people get angry because they don’t like to wear them, but seat belts can prevent serious injuries if you have an accident. So remember, when you get into a car, you must wear your seat belt!

2. Of course, police officers also investigate crimes like robberies. When there has been a crime, police officers are sent to the place where it happened. They need to look for evidence, like fingerprints and footprints, which can be used to identify and arrest the criminal. Of course, they don’t have to recognize the fingerprints themselves! There are fingerprint experts who do that. Police officers also have to ask a lot of questions. They interview witnesses who they think might have information about the crime. Witnesses can help the police by telling them what a criminal looks like or what time a crime was committed.

3. Police officers try to prevent crimes as well as solve crimes. They often watch places where they think crimes are likely to happen. For example, crowded areas attract pickpockets who try to steal people’s wallets. Shops that sell expensive items also attract thieves. But police officers also help people with everyday problems. For example, if you’re lost, you needn’t worry, you can just ask a police officer for directions!

Have you ever thought about joining the military?

There are many different military jobs, so you should be able to find one that’s right for you. The military has three branches: the Land Force, the Navy and the Air Force. If you choose the Land Force, you can help protect the country from the ground. In the Navy you can work on or with the ships that protect our waters. If you like aircraft, you can join the Air Force and work with aeroplanes and helicopters. You must be 18 years old to join.

Not all jobs in the military involve fighting. For example, there are many interesting jobs for people with a technical background. If you are interested in computers, you can become a computer specialist. The military needs computers to keep and organize information about many things, such as the weather and temperature. And it needs people who know computers to install and maintain the software and hardware.

There are also non-technical jobs in the military. Drivers are usually needed to transport food and equipment from one place to another. You might have to use a radio, but you needn’t be very technical. But you do have to be in good physical condition. Driving a military vehicle is not like driving your car on the road! You must be able to drive off the road and in bad weather conditions.

Most people want a chance to get a better job if they are good at what they do. In the military, you can take a test to become an officer. Officers have more responsibility and more difficult jobs, but many people think those jobs are also more interesting. Officers can do many different jobs, too: they can pilot aeroplanes, supervise computer technicians, or even be doctors at the army base.

You don’t have to have a lot of experience when you join the military. When you start, you spend a lot of time learning new things in a classroom. Then you get a lot of practice using your new skills. The things you learn are not only useful while you are in the military, but can be useful outside, too. This means that when you leave the military, your training can help you find a civilian job.

Now do Exercises A to D on pages 30 and 31 of the Workbook.

Lesson 6: A Robbery

A Skim the two texts. Are they about the same or different events?

A robbery occurred last night at 11:00 at 305 Park Drive. The owners of the house, Mr and Mrs Smith, were at home and asleep at the time of the robbery. Money, jewellery and a computer were stolen, but no one was injured. At 11:15, police were alerted by Mr Smith, who says his daughter, Sue, woke him up after hearing a loud noise. When he went downstairs to investigate, he found a broken vase on the floor. He then realized his computer was missing, and immediately called the police.

The police believe the robber may have got in the house through a window. A witness told the police she had seen a tall man in a dark blue jacket run out of the house and drive away in a red car. The police haven’t arrested anyone for the crime yet. None of the missing property has been found.

This was the fifth robbery in town this year, and police think the same man may be responsible. They are reminding homeowners to lock their doors at night and keep ground floor windows closed.

From: Sue
To: Ann
Subject: You won’t believe what happened

Dear Ann,
You won’t believe what happened last night. I was sound asleep, when all of a sudden I heard a loud crash. Of course, I was terrified. I knew my parents were asleep (it was around 11.00), but I thought I heard somebody downstairs. I didn’t know what to do, so I ran to wake my parents. My father made me go back to my room, then he went downstairs to find out what had happened. He found a big mess. There were papers and a broken vase on the living room floor. We had been robbed! My father called the police. Luckily, the burglar had already left, and no one got hurt.

I’m not scared any more, but I feel really angry. My father had his computer stolen and my science report was on the hard disk! Now I have to write it all over again. And the jewellery my father gave my mother for her birthday was stolen, too. She’s really upset.

The police told us they think the robber came in through the window. My father is getting the lock replaced today. The police were very nice, but they don’t think we’ll get our things back. Well, I’ll tell you more about it at school tomorrow.

See you soon,
Sue

Lesson 7: A Safety Brochure

A Skim the paragraphs from a safety brochure published for the public by the Police Department. What is its purpose?

1 to give information about different types of crime
2 to persuade people to take security measures in their home
3 to sell burglar alarms

EVERYONE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOME SAFETY

Why should you think about home safety? Every year, hundreds of people have their homes robbed. Thieves take money, jewellery, computers and even television sets. Then they sell them again, often to people who don't realize they are buying stolen property. Many people have insurance that pays for things that get stolen. But some things can't be replaced. For example, jewellery can have sentimental value. And if you get your computer stolen, you could lose hours of work on your hard disk.

Basic measures: windows, doors and locks

What are the most important things for home safety? Good windows, doors and locks are extremely important. Many thieves come in through open windows. Make sure your windows have good locks and lock them when you go out. Burglars can hide behind trees and bushes, so don’t plant any near your windows. Get good locks for your doors, too. Some are unbelievably easy to open without a key for an experienced burglar. They can open your door with a bank card or a paper clip! But a good lock is almost impossible to unlock without the key. A good door is also essential. Make sure your door is solid. Have your house examined by an expert, who can tell you if you need to make your house more secure.

Unit 2 Lesson 8: Security Technology

A Scan the text and find:
1. one number.
2. at least five useful linking phrases.
3. three vehicles.
4. a word that means 'rain, snow, sunny or cloudy'.

RADAR

Radar was invented during World War II to detect enemy aircraft and ships. After that, it was used for many other things, including weather prediction. Police officers started using radar speed guns to catch speeders over 50 years ago. Although new technology is being developed today, radar speed guns are still one of the most common tools in law enforcement.

A radar speed gun works by sending radio waves towards a car. When the waves hit the car, they bounce back towards the radar gun. If the car isn’t moving, the radio waves are the same as when they were sent. If the car is moving, however, the space between the radio waves changes. The radar gun uses this information to calculate the speed of the car. Radar guns work when the car is moving towards or away from them. So you can’t avoid a ticket by speeding away!

There are different types of radar guns. Some are handheld and are shaped a bit like guns. They can be used by police officers who are waiting for speeders by the side of the road. Police officers can also use them from moving vehicles. In that case, the radar gun takes into account the speed of the police vehicle. Some radar guns can take a picture of a car’s number plate as well as measure its speed. With this type of radar gun, police don’t have to stop the speeding car. They use the information on the number plate to identify the owner of the car. They then send him or her a speeding ticket.

Some drivers try to avoid radar guns so that they won’t get tickets. They use radar detectors that detect if a radar gun is being used nearby. These machines make a beeping sound when they detect a radar gun, and the driver slows down. However, some police officers don’t turn on their radar guns until they see a car that they think is speeding. If that happens, the radar gun measures the driver’s speed before the driver even knows the radar gun is there. Another problem is that, in some places, radar detectors are illegal and you can get a fine for having one.

Some people claim radar guns can make mistakes and that drivers get tickets when they shouldn’t. However, there aren’t many mistakes if the radar guns are used correctly and police officers are trained to use them properly. There are also rules about radar gun maintenance. If the radar guns are checked and fixed regularly, they are an essential tool in helping keep our roads safe.

MEET ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PHYSICIANS IN LIBYA!
This week Latifa Ahmed interviews a famous surgeon.

What kind of organ transplants are you famous for?
I have performed over 350 organ transplants, many of which were kidney and liver transplants.

What is the success rate of these transplants?
We have had a high success rate of 95%.

When did you decide to become a physician?
It has been my dream since childhood.

Why?
I did very well at school and was interested in making a difference to other people's lives. I wanted a career that I would enjoy and that would be useful.

Can you tell me more about your background?
I was born in Libya and studied medicine at Benghazi University. I began my career as a surgeon in 1979 at Tripoli Central Hospital. After many different medical and academic jobs, I started working on organ transplantation in 2003, as the Director of the National Transplant programme.

How many publications do you have on organ transplantation?
I have written many books on surgery and organ transplantation, some of which are used to teach medical students.

What advice would you give to younger medical students?
Anyone can make a difference in life with hard work and patience.

B Write the interviewer's questions in reported speech.

1 Many foreign students study at UCL.
2 Dr Ibrahim qualified recently.
3 Most operations are quite similar.
4 Surgeons work alone most of the time.
5 Being a brain surgeon is hard work.
6 Saving lives is the best part of Dr Ibrahim's job.

The place is the Hilton Hotel, Abu Dhabi, and the annual Arab Conference of Surgery has just broken for lunch. We interviewed Dr Ibrahim Al Mahmoud, a leading Libyan brain surgeon, about his career so far.

Asked how he got into brain surgery, Dr Ibrahim says, "I studied neurosciences at university, and was fascinated with how the brain worked. So, after that I decided to go to medical school and study to be a brain surgeon. I went to UCL — University College London. The diversity in London was amazing — there were students there from all over the world. It was very exciting for me. I also remember sitting in class on the first day, wondering, 'How are they going to teach me how to become a brain surgeon?' I felt like there was so much to learn.

"After that I did my medical residency at the American University of Beirut. I went there because it was a very good programme, and I knew that I would get excellent training. The school performs many operations and has exceptional professors. I knew I would learn a lot from them."

That was thirty years ago. Now Dr Ibrahim is a neurosurgeon at Tripoli Hospital, and every day he performs difficult, life-saving operations. Sometimes he operates on patients’ brains, other times it’s their spines. Every surgery is different and presents new challenges. Next, we asked him about preparing for surgery. "Before I go into surgery, I prepare by going over the case and thinking about the procedure. I read all the notes I have, and look carefully at all the scans, in high resolution. I also ask my clinical team of surgical technicians and nurses to do the same, even though they are not operating themselves. I like everyone in the room to understand exactly what I am doing. I’m lucky in that I have built a team around me that I trust 100%. We’ve worked together for more than five years, so we function very well as a unit."

It’s something that people probably don’t think about, but surgeons have to keep their hands extremely still during the delicate parts of operations. I avoid going to the gym or playing sports the day before surgery, to avoid my hands shaking even a tiny bit. I don’t drink coffee or cola before surgery either, for the same reason."

For Dr Ibrahim, being a surgeon is not a job; it’s a way of life. It's extremely demanding, and it has taken over his life completely. But he wouldn’t want to do anything else. "It’s my passion," he says. "I really love what I do. It’s not just about the surgery. It’s not just about saving lives, either, although that is an incredible feeling. For me, it’s about being a doctor. I feel part of a huge, worldwide community and it makes me very proud."

B Now do Exercises A to D on pages 59 and 60 of the Workbook.

C Study the careers in this unit. Is there a career you are interested in? In pairs, talk about your hopes for your career. What challenges will you face along the way?

Unit 4
Lesson 1: Doctors Direct
A Read the interview and answer the questions.
1 What job did Dr Sarah Khan use to have?
2 How does Doctors Direct help people?

Meet ...
DR DOT COM!
Dr Sarah Khan runs an online service which lets a patient book an appointment, see a doctor face-to-face and receive a prescription for medicine, all via a mobile app. Patients can usually see a doctor within 24 hours of making an appointment. We interviewed Dr Khan at the Doctors Direct head office, in Cairo, Egypt.

Where did you come up with the idea for Doctors Direct?
I used to work in a local doctor’s surgery in Nasr City, near Cairo. I loved working there, but it was frustrating. My patients used to complain that they couldn’t see a doctor for three weeks or more! I thought, “This is no good.” So I had the idea for Doctors Direct, where people can see a doctor over the phone, through an app.

How does the service work?
Well, first patients download the app onto their phone. Next they register as a patient, and fill in a form with their medical details. They make an appointment with a doctor at a convenient time for them. The doctor calls them at the appointment time and they discuss their medical problem. The doctor gives advice and, if necessary, prescribes medicine. Then the patient collects their medicine from a local pharmacy. It’s an especially useful service for people who live in remote areas or who find it hard to leave the house.

Who can use the service?
Anybody with a mobile phone. This idea wouldn’t have worked in the past, because people used to use their phones only for calls and text messages. They didn’t have apps or the internet. Nowadays, almost everyone has a smartphone or has a family member that does. That’s why Doctors Direct has been so successful.

Is it difficult to treat patients via an app?
For some patients, of course, it can be very difficult. For serious illnesses, we have to tell patients to go to hospital to see a specialist because we cannot help them. But every week we help hundreds of patients with more everyday problems, by offering advice, reassurance and, when necessary, medicine.

Who works for Doctors Direct?
We have more than a hundred doctors registered. Many of them used to work in local surgeries, like me, or local hospitals. Others still work locally most of the time and work for Doctors Direct one or two days a week.

Unit 4 Lesson 3: What's your personality type?

A Read the text. Which personality type do you think you are?

Many doctors believe there are two main types of personality – Type A and Type B. Type A people are ambitious, hard-working and competitive. They are usually in a hurry and they can be impatient. Type B people are more relaxed. They are more patient, and they enjoy talking and being sociable. Of course, both personality types are equally valuable in society. And each type is suited to different types of jobs. For example, a doctor with Type B personality would do well in research. And a doctor with Type A personality will do well as a surgeon or working in accident and emergency.

Which personality type are you? Why not take the test and find out!

B Tick (✓) one column each time.

1. I usually finish class work before everyone else.
2. I talk more than most people.
3. I am nearly always hard-working and serious.
4. I get angry if people are late for appointments.
5. I sometimes stop listening when people are talking.
6. I am often in a hurry.
7. I have to do physical exercise at least four times a week.
8. I often do two things at once, like watching TV and doing homework.
9. I feel annoyed if I don’t win a game.
10. I often interrupt when people are talking.
11. I start revising for tests two weeks in advance.
12. I often feel impatient with other people.
13. If I want to get something done well, I know I have to do it myself.
14. I expect to be the best at everything I do.
15. I would die of boredom if I ever had to spend a month alone on a desert island.

Score one point for each Yes. Score zero for each No. Scores of 8 and above are A personalities. Scores of 7 and below are B personalities.

C Now do Exercises A to G on pages 65 to 68 of the Workbook.

The Happy Traveller

This week Steve Harper tells us about his favourite Libyan tour company, Safar Tours.

I've been coming to Libya on business since 2009. In fact, all in all I've visited this country fifteen times now and I still thoroughly enjoy my trips here. I usually extend my stay by a couple of extra days because one of the things I love doing here is going on excursions and doing some sightseeing. That's how I discovered Safar Tours, which is one of Libya’s longest established travel companies. In fact, Safar Tours has been organizing trips and excursions for over thirty years.

Ahmed Salim is the owner and manager of Safar Tours. I've known him for three years now, and I can honestly say that all his tours have most definitely lived up to my expectations. I have never been disappointed in any way by any of the tours he has organized for me. I've been on trips to the desert, I have visited most of the ancient ruins in Libya. I have been to the Leptis Magna in Khoms, Sabratha, Tripoli’s National Museum, Shahat, and been to the Libyan Sahara three times already. And that’s only to name a few!

Safar Tours was started by Ahmed’s father, Ibrahim, in 1976, in a little office in Al Rasheed Street. Over the years, the business has grown considerably and they’ve moved offices several times. Since last July, they have had a very attractive modern office on Al Sa’doon Street. I arrived here last Monday. So I’ve now been in Libya for eight days. Since Thursday, when I finished my business, I have been going on tours around the country. I could never have achieved so much without the help of Ahmed Salim at Safar Tours. I certainly wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this company to anyone considering an extended stay in Libya.

Unit 5 Lesson 6: Trip Review

A Scan the text about a holiday in Tunisia. Find one piece of information about each of the following:
• the journey  • the food  • the hotel  • the activities

Kerkennah Islands

My cousin and I have recently returned from a wonderful fortnight in the Tunisian Kerkennah Islands. It was a package deal and cost us £180. This included the flight from London to Sfax, bus transfers to and from Sfax airport, and the ferry to and from the island. The accommodation was in a three-star hotel with breakfast and dinner every day. The cost even included entertainment in the evenings. I couldn’t believe how cheap it was!

From Sfax airport, we were taken to the ferry port, where we boarded a rather old ferry! It took us across to the islands, which looked really beautiful in the evening sun. We were delighted that our hotel overlooked the beach and was just a short walk away. Although not very luxurious, it was a really pleasant two-storey building that was set in an attractive garden with its own swimming pool and tennis courts. Our room had its own private bathroom and balcony with a spectacular view of the calm, blue Mediterranean Sea. The atmosphere was really peaceful – that’s what I really liked.

The food was exceptionally good. There was a self-service buffet in the dining room with a variety of dishes, both regional and international. You could eat as much as you wanted! Breakfast consisted of fruit, cereal, eggs, cakes, bread, honey, olives and cheese. There was a different selection of dishes for supper every night and there was a lot of great seafood. I loved the octopus, which is a speciality in Kerkennah.

We weren’t bored for a moment. One day we hired a taxi and went on a tour of the island. We saw the villages where the fishermen catch octopus in clay pots. Another day we went for a camel ride on the beach, and we even hired surfboards from the hotel and learnt to windsurf. We also went for a ride in a donkey cart and toured some villages.

What really impressed me was the hospitality of the local people. Several islanders invited us into their homes for mint tea and cakes. We also took the ferry back to the mainland to see the magnificent Roman theatre at El Jem. Something else that we really enjoyed was the free entertainment in the hotel after supper. One evening some local men gave an incredible display of lying on a bed of nails and glass, walking over hot coals, breathing fire and letting scorpions walk all over their faces! We shall certainly never forget that holiday.

Unit 5 Lesson 8: Happy Holidays

A Work in groups. Discuss the title and picture. What do you think the text will be about?

B Skim the text and match the headings to the correct paragraphs.

1 ❑ What stress can do
2 ❑ A change can do you good
3 ❑ Time for others
4 ❑ Time to relax is important
5 ❑ Too busy to leave work

A
Today it is more important than ever to ensure that we take enough breaks and holidays. Life is so fast and we spend such a large part of our time working hard that we really need to take sufficient time out. If we don’t, the pressure of life can affect both our physical and mental health.

B
The stress of modern life can cause severe problems. It can cause high blood pressure, which can then cause strokes and heart attacks. It also has an effect on our minds. If we are always on the move, we don’t always notice how far we push our bodies. We don’t eat regular meals, we don’t get enough sleep and our free time is often interrupted by phone calls. The human body cannot continue like this indefinitely. Both brain and body need a break. If we push them too far, they will eventually let us down.

C
There are more and more ‘workaholics’ these days who think that their work is too important to leave in the hands of others. These people cannot bear to be away from the office for more than a few hours. They put off taking holidays or breaks because there is always another deadline or another deal around the corner. They often discover too late that there is more to life than work.

D
People like this risk hurting not only their health but their personal relationships, too. Everyone needs to spend time with family or friends, and this time needs to be more than the occasional snatched hour here or there. People who are close to us need to know that we care about them. Giving them a significant amount of our time is how we show this. Holiday time can give us this opportunity.

E
Holidays are important for everyone, not just the businessman. We all need a change of scene and a change of pace. We need to relax and take our minds off work, school, the house or whatever problems are worrying us at the time. It doesn’t matter whether we choose to spend this time lying on a beach, trekking through rainforests or sightseeing. What is important is the change. A change of routine often helps us to look at our own lives in a different way. Holidays are vital to our general well-being. And leaving the mobile phone switched off. That is vital, too!

C Now do Exercises A to D on pages 94 and 95 of the Workbook.

Unit 6 Lesson 3: Meet a Banker

A Skim the text. What is the main topic? Tick (✓) the best description.

1 The amount of money bankers make.
2 What you must study at school to become a banker.
3 What a banker’s job is like.

I’VE BEEN A BANKER for twenty years and I love my job. What makes it particularly interesting is the variety. I have to do many different things and use a number of different skills. No two days are ever the same. Most importantly, we have to convince people to use the bank, and one way to do this is to offer new services. For example, we can attract students by offering special student accounts if the bank is close to a university or college. We also advise people on the most suitable accounts for their needs.

Another of my main responsibilities is to decide whether or not to give people or companies loans. This is one way the bank uses the money people put into their accounts. The money doesn’t simply sit there but is used to make more money. Many people need loans for a special project such as buying a car or a house. We also lend money to people who want to start their own businesses. It is often up to me to decide whether the business is a good idea or not, and sometimes I must make suggestions to improve their plans. For example, if a man wants to open a bookshop on a street that already has several bookshops, I might suggest that he opens it on another street where he can get more customers. Unfortunately, I cannot always approve a loan. This is a difficult part of my job as I do not like to disappoint my clients.

Some bankers work mostly with large companies, while others have more to do with small businesses and individuals. Both types of banking can be enjoyable. Banks that work with large companies can help them improve and extend their businesses. This can be very interesting and exciting, as you have to be quite knowledgeable about many different subjects.

If you work with a company that makes chemical products, for example, you have to understand how the products are made and used. My main work is with individuals and small businesses. What I particularly enjoy about this is that I meet a range of different people. It is also very satisfying to be able to help them with their problems and make a difference in their lives.

Being a banker requires many different skills. To begin with, you have to be good at maths and able to read and understand graphs and charts quickly. Another important skill is being able to work with other experts who can give you important information. When a client wants a loan to buy a house, for example, I need to know about the value and structure of the house and what sort of neighbourhood it is in. A specialist can give me this information. Finally, a banker needs to be a good communicator. Your clients need information about many different things, some of them quite complex. They need a banker who can explain these things clearly and who enjoys helping them.

To: Mazen Tahir &lt;Mazen Tahir&gt;
Subject: Trip to London
Date: 15 January, 2019
Time: 12:49

Dear Mazen,

Guess what? Tomorrow is the big day! My plane leaves for London at 3.00, and soon I'll be able to see all the sights we read about in the guidebook.

I've already packed my suitcase. I bought some new clothes and a couple more guidebooks. I tried not to pack too much, but it's pretty heavy. Once I get to England, I'll have to take a taxi. There's no way I can carry it all on the Underground! I wonder how much you tip taxi drivers in England?

Last Monday I went to the bank and got some traveller's cheques for my trip. They're great because they're safer than cash. I signed the cheques in one place at the bank, and when I want to buy something in London, I have to sign the cheque again in front of the cashier. That way, nobody else can use them.

My banker told me I should also get some local currency, because not all places take traveller's cheques. I'll take my credit card, too. That's accepted internationally, but I can't really use it to tip the taxi driver or travel round by bus or Underground! So I will definitely need some cash in my pocket. As you probably know, many countries in Europe use the euro, but in the UK people use pounds. Do you know the exchange rate between Libyan dinars and pounds? One Libyan dinar is almost 0.54 pounds. My father told me everything in London is expensive, so I'll have to be careful what I spend.

I'll bring you back a souvenir. Let me know if there's anything particular you'd like me to get you, and keep in touch. There's an internet café next to my hotel, so I can check my email whenever I want.

See you in ten days!
Hazem

Unit 6 Lesson 6: A Car Loan

A Read and listen to the conversation.

Ahlam: Wow! Is that your car?
Nour: Yes! Nice, isn’t it? I bought it yesterday. Do you want to go for a drive? We could go to the beach.
Ahlam: Sure, that’s a great idea. I’d love a car like this one. How did you pay for it?
Nour: I got a car loan.
Ahlam: That’s a good idea. Maybe I should do that. If I got a car loan, would I have to make a big down payment?
Nour: No. I didn’t pay any money in advance at all. I just have to pay a certain amount every month.
Ahlam: That’s even better! But the monthly instalments must be pretty high. What are they?
Nour: About 800 Libyan dinars. It wasn’t that expensive, because it isn’t a new car.

Nour: The owner took really good care of it. It’s actually three years old.
Ahlam: How long do you have to pay it back?
Nour: Five years.
Ahlam: That’s a long time. Won’t it cost you a lot in interest?
Nour: Yeah. But it’s worth it. This sort of car is a real investment. It won’t lose money. In fact, it may even go up in value.
Ahlam: Well, I suppose it’s more enjoyable than investing your money in a business and waiting for it to make a profit. Maybe I should make an investment like this.
Nour: Here we are. The beach. Do you think I can fit into that parking space?
Ahlam: Sure. Uh, no, maybe not. (Sound of crash) Oh, no. I think one of your lights is broken.
Nour: Luckily, the loan also includes free car insurance!

Thanks for your email and the photos. If I had a waterproof phone case, I would have taken some pictures, too. It’s nice to have pictures taken underwater.

That shop where you got your waterproof phone case is really good. We haven’t got anything like it near us. Could you buy me one like yours? I’d be so grateful. If you can get me one, let me know how much it costs and I’ll transfer you the money.

It was great to see you at the party. I’m sorry I couldn’t stay for long.

Best wishes,

Unit 6 Lesson 8: Making Money

A Work in pairs. Read the title of the text then talk about what points you think might be mentioned in the text.

B Now read the first sentence of each paragraph and check your ideas.

Making more from your money

Saving for the future is something that is instilled in us from an early age. As children, we learn not to spend all our pocket money at once but to put some aside to buy something bigger later on. When we start work, we are encouraged to put money into pension plans to save for our retirement so that we can continue to enjoy a good standard of living when we are older.

There are many ways in which we can make our money work for us. Financially-minded people who follow the markets invest in stocks and shares. For many, this can be both a hobby and a way of making a lot of money. It’s a risky business, however, and there are no guarantees. The major players in this game are the specialists. You can certainly lose a lot of money as well as gain it, and it is not the answer for people who need a fixed sum at the end of their investment period.

Money can also be made through investing in property. Spending a lot of money to begin with can bring significant profit if the property is sold on at a later date when property prices have increased. Once again, there is no guarantee that you will make a profit or even break even, but generally speaking, money invested in property is safe in the long term. It is this type of investment that is becoming more and more popular in the UK at the moment. People are beginning to see the value of buying up property to rent out. The rent pays the instalments on the loan or mortgage, and then when the investor needs the money he or she can sell up and realize the profit. This is particularly popular with people who inherit an amount of money who want to do more with the money than let it sit in a savings account.

However people choose to invest their money, whether it is in savings accounts, pension plans, stocks and shares or property, etc., it is more sensible than keeping it in a box under the bed as our grandparents often used to do! And although some young people cannot see the value in saving for their old age when they are still in their twenties, there are a lot of retired people today who wish they had done more with their money when they were younger.

C Now do Exercises A to D on pages 115 and 116 of the Workbook.

Lesson 3: Improving Your Computer Skills

A Work in pairs. Discuss the kind of computer skills you feel it is important to learn.

B Read the article below and list the computer skills mentioned.

Work Today

THERE ARE many ways in which you can improve your job prospects. One of them is to take computer classes. Computers are used in more and more businesses, and most job seekers should be familiar with basic computer programs. Learning new computer skills can also help you change careers, and the number of people enrolling in computer classes is increasing.

Depending on the class they choose, students can learn basic or more advanced computer skills. Classes that teach the use of spreadsheets are popular, since spreadsheets are used in many businesses to show information in table form. For example, spreadsheets are very often used to show financial information. Photographers and artists may want to take classes in digital graphic design. People with these skills can help create illustrations for publishers or advertising agencies, or work in television. Classes in web design, which teach how to create and maintain a company website, are becoming more and more popular.

While computer classes are a part of many university programmes, you don’t have to be a student to take a computer class. Many universities offer continuing education classes that you can take in the evening. There are also an increasing number of online classes that you can take from home. The advantage of these classes is that you can study whenever you want. If you decide to take a class online, make sure you get information about the site that is offering the class. Some are excellent and can help you get a better job, but others are not very good. Finally, if you are very self-disciplined and can work without a teacher, you can buy an app about computers and teach yourself, but explanations can sometimes be quite complex and need practical demonstration.

Lesson 5: Volunteers at the Hospital

A Work in pairs. Discuss the questions below.
- What is a volunteer?
- Why do people volunteer?
- How can you find volunteer work?
- What can you learn from volunteering?

B Read the three paragraphs and make notes in Exercise A on page 126 of the Workbook.

1
There have been a lot of natural disasters in the last few years, and they made me realize I wanted to do something that would help other people. I decided then that I was going to become a volunteer, working for an organization without being paid. I looked at internet sites to get information about volunteer opportunities. I saw that the Children’s Hospital needed volunteers for many different jobs, such as playing with the children, giving patients directions and typing letters. I’m a librarian, so I decided to volunteer to work in the hospital library. I organize the medical books and magazines that the doctors and nurses read. I also supervise young volunteers, so I now have management skills as well as library skills. This experience has helped me get a job with more responsibilities.

2
I’m 18 years old and I’m graduating in the spring. I think I might want to be a nurse, but I’m not sure. I’m volunteering at the Children’s Hospital to help me decide if working in a hospital is the right job for me. I work a four-hour shift, answering the phones and giving information to patients and their parents. Although I don’t do what nurses do, I work with them a lot and talk to them about their job. As a result, I’m getting a very good idea of what a nurse’s day is like. I really enjoy my job, and I’ve made a lot of new friends, too. If anyone wants to do volunteer work, I advise them to contact a charity they are interested in supporting.

3
When I started volunteering at the hospital, I spent a lot of time with the children. Being ill is never fun, but children can get scared when they are in a hospital and I wanted to make them feel better. I went to visit them in their rooms and played with them and read them stories. After that, I got a different volunteer job writing articles in the hospital newsletter. The two jobs are very different. To work with children, you have to enjoy working with people, whereas to write articles you have to be able to work on your own. I miss working with the children, but working on the newsletter has taught me a lot of new skills.

Lesson 7: Books and the Internet

A Read about essays that express opinions in Exercise A on page 130 of the Workbook. What information is presented in the body of the essay?

A On the whole, I think that the internet is very useful if you want to get general information about a topic. But if you really want to learn, a book is better.

B Unlike the authors of websites, the authors of books are easy to identify. It is therefore easier to decide if a book is reliable. Books also give you more in-depth information than the internet because they are longer than the texts on most websites. In addition to having more content, you can read a book wherever you are. Although using the internet is convenient, it is becoming easier to get books without leaving your home by ordering them online.

C With the arrival of the internet, some people thought we would not need books any longer, but people are still buying books and borrowing books from the library in great numbers. In this essay, I will look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using the internet and buying books.

D One of the main advantages of the internet is that it is convenient. You do not need to go to the bookshop or the library. If you have an internet connection, you can get information from home at any time. The internet lets you get information from a lot of different sources, for instance, from articles, from explanations in an online encyclopedia, or even from chatting with other people about a subject that interests you. Once you have an internet connection it is also cheaper than buying books. However, the different sources of information are not always reliable. People can write whatever they want on their website, and it is not always true.

Unit 7 Lesson 8: Using the Library

A Read the text and choose the best title.
a How to pass your exams  b A new career  c Working in a bank

B Read one paragraph and then explain the content in your own words.

When I left school, I started working for a bank. I gave people information about their accounts and cashed cheques. I enjoyed it for a while, but then I decided it wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I had this idea that I would quite like a job which involved travelling. However, I didn’t know what sorts of jobs there were or what I needed to study. So I started coming to the Central Library of Tripoli regularly to look for information that might help me. I was astounded by the help that is available to people like me.

The library has a range of information for people who are looking for the right career. Firstly, there’s a whole section of books about different careers. They describe the various jobs and also tell you what skills or qualifications you need to do them. I’ve been taking a different book out each week. It’s really interesting. A lot of the time we only think about the jobs that we often hear about, but there are so many unusual jobs around. And with new technology, new jobs are appearing all the time. There are also books with advice on how to find job vacancies and also how to prepare for and get through interviews. I’ve learnt a lot about how important body language is in an interview and also how to look businesslike. They explain how to write a good CV too, which is really important.

If I need to learn new things or take extra qualifications, I can get information about classes at the library, too. They have some school and college catalogues, and there are computers where I can look for information about evening and summer classes. I hadn’t realized there were so many different things I could study! Since I want to travel, I’m sure I’ll need better language skills, so I definitely need to improve my English, and maybe learn another language, too. In addition to information about the classes, the library also has a lot of its own materials to help me do this. It has books in English, and also lets you borrow DVDs with language-learning games and exercises. They have information about language tests, and practice books to help prepare for examinations if you need the qualifications.

Another important section at the library is its daily selection of newspapers and magazines. I look through these to find job offers because it’s good to know what jobs are available. I also look at interesting job sites on the internet. The librarians have told me how to get information about companies. I can find out where they are, what they do and how big they are. This will be useful information when I decide to apply for a new job. I'm sure all this research will pay off and that one day I will have my dream job. And it will all be thanks to the library.

Unit 8
Lesson 1: Our Natural Resources

A Look at the pictures. Which are natural resources?

water petrol soda fish trees

B Work in pairs. Discuss the questions below.
1 What other natural resources can you think of?
2 What do we use them for?
3 What problems are caused by the way we use some of them?

C Skim the texts and match each paragraph to the most appropriate picture.

a Natural resources are materials that are found in nature. Air, water, land and trees are all natural resources, as are petrol and gas. We use natural resources in hundreds of different ways. For example, we use land to grow food and water to drink. We use petrol and gas for energy. Because they are so essential to human life, natural resources must be used wisely.

b Some natural resources are renewable. This means that they do not disappear completely when they are used, or that they can replace themselves as quickly as they are used. Trees are a renewable resource because more trees can be planted and grow. Some resources, however, are non-renewable. These cannot replace themselves as quickly as they are used. Petrol is considered a non-renewable resource because it takes thousands of years to form. We know that non-renewable resources must be used as efficiently as possible, and we must concentrate on developing other methods of using renewable resources, such as energy from the Sun.

c Sometimes, the way we use natural resources can harm the environment. Coal and petrol cause greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Another potentially disastrous activity is that large numbers of trees are cut down by farmers or logging companies, and new ones cannot grow fast enough to replace them. This process is called deforestation, and endangers the habitats of other plants and many animals. Destruction of the previously plentiful rainforest is particularly worrying, as these trees are the source of much of the world’s oxygen. Fortunately, scientists are finding ways to limit damage to the environment when these resources are used, but a lot of work still needs to be done.

Lesson 2: Recycling Waste

A Work in pairs. Look at the pictures and discuss what they have in common.

B Read the text and check your predictions.

Dealing with waste is a major problem in most countries. Statistics show that each person in industrial countries throws away an average of two kilograms of waste each day. That’s 14 kg a week, or more than 700 kg a year! This waste is often burnt or buried under the earth. These methods both cause pollution. Streams and rivers and even the sea can be polluted by buried waste.

One solution is to encourage people to recycle their waste. A simple method is to give each home different-coloured plastic bags in which to place their waste. In some cities they use green bags for paper (envelopes, newspapers, writing paper and so on), yellow for plastic (plastic bottles, plastic bags, etc.), blue for glass and brown for biological waste (food and garden waste).

Today, more and more people are recycling their waste. In some countries, more than 50% of waste is recycled. Glass, paper and plastic can all be used again, both saving money and helping to protect the environment.

C Do Exercise A on page 136 of the Workbook. Then listen to a description of how waste can be recycled. Complete the flow chart below with the correct words from the box in the passive form.

Waste is sorted at home. 
It is (1) in different bags. 
It is (2) by a refuse lorry. 
It is (3) to a waste treatment plant. 
It is (4) into different types. 
It is (5) in special machines. 
Glass, paper and plastic are (6) again.

Lesson 4: Irrigation – A Case Study

A Look at the pictures. What do you think the article will be about?

Agriculture is fundamental to the success of the human species. It is our ability to grow food for ourselves that sets us apart from all other creatures on Earth. To grow crops, we need to be able to water the soil regularly, and in controlled amounts. To move water from one place to another, we need irrigation systems.

Humans have been irrigating the land for thousands of years. Early irrigation systems involved capturing rainwater in the uplands during the rainy season, then channelling the water downhill to the crop fields during the dry season. Later, people learned to dig networks of channels to redirect water over much longer distances into deserts. This made it possible for civilizations to thrive in areas of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia (the modern-day Middle East).

Irrigation has developed even more quickly in the last century. Modern irrigation systems are very advanced, and there are many complex systems in use around the world. Water can be piped at high pressure for thousands of miles and dripped or sprinkled onto crops in the precise quantities required to maximize growth.

However, as with all technological advances, humans must use irrigation responsibly. Terrible things can happen if we mismanage technology. Take the example of the Aral Sea, which used to be the fourth largest lake in the world. In the 1960s, a system was built to redirect water from the Darya river to irrigate about two million hectares of farmland. The shocking result can be seen in picture C above. By 2014, the lake had shrunk to a fraction of its original size, and parts of it had dried up completely.

B Read the article and check your answers to Exercise A. Then write a heading for each section.

Unit 3
Conditional sentences
(CB page 33, 34 and 38 and WB page 43)
There are four main conditional structures in English: the zero conditional, the first conditional, the second conditional and the third conditional. Conditional structures have two clauses: the if clause, and the main clause. The if clause can be placed at the beginning or the end of the sentence. If it comes first, it should be separated from the main clause by a comma.

Form
| if clause | Main clause
Zero conditional | present simple | present simple
First conditional | present simple | will/can/may + infinitive
Second conditional | past simple | would/could/ might + infinitive
Third conditional | past perfect | would/could + have + past participle

Use
Use the zero conditional when the action in the main clause is always true when the if clause is true:
Example: If you click on this icon, the computer saves your document. (Every time you click on this icon, the computer saves your document.)

Use the first conditional when you think the if clause is likely:
Example: If it is sunny tomorrow, I’ll wear my sunglasses. (I think it’s likely that it will be sunny tomorrow.)

Use the second conditional to make sentences about events that are not likely, impossible or untrue in the present or future.
Example: If I had enough money, I would buy a car. (I don’t have enough money, so I can’t buy a car.)

Use the third conditional to talk about imaginary events and results in the past.
Example: If we had known about the problem yesterday, we could have solved it last night. (But we didn’t know about the problem yesterday so we didn’t solve it last night.)

Reported questions (WB page 47)
Use
Use reported questions to tell another person what somebody said.

Form
Introduce reported questions with ask. These reporting verbs are always followed by an object – a noun or a pronoun.

Reported statements
• Ali: ‘I am tired.’
  Ali said (that) he was tired.
• Mum: ‘It’s time to get up, Bilal!’
  Mum told Bilal (that) it was time to get up.

‘that’ can be left out.

Change the tense of some, but not all verbs:
| direct speech | reported speech
present simple | past simple
present continuous | past continuous
past simple | past perfect
present perfect | past perfect
can | could
should | should
could | could
will | would

• Khalid: ‘I don’t want to go to bed.’
  Khalid said he didn’t want to go to bed.
• Dad: ‘Faisal can go with you.’
  Dad told us Faisal could go with us.
• Mum: ‘You should eat more fruit.’
  Mum said I should eat more fruit.
• Sara: ‘I couldn’t sleep last night.’
  Sara said she couldn’t sleep last night.

Change the pronouns.
• I > he or she
• we > they
• me > him or her
• us > them

Reported questions
They become statements when they are reported.
• Marwa: ‘What time is it?’
  Marwa asked me what time it was.

Use if in yes/no questions.
• Students: ‘Is Abdulla ill?’
  They asked me if Abdulla was ill.

نبذة عن الصفحة : تبدو الصورة كصفحة من كتاب تعليمي للغة الإنجليزية، تحتوي على شروحات قواعدية حول الأزمنة والجمل الوصفية. الصفحة مقسمة إلى عدة أقسام، كل منها يشرح موضوعًا معينًا مع أمثلة توضيحية. هناك أيضًا توضيحات حول كيفية استخدام الأزمنة المختلفة والجمل الوصفية في اللغة الإنجليزية.

النص المُستخرج من الصفحة : 
• Present perfect simple and past simple (WB page 81)
Use the present perfect simple to talk about situations that started in the past and continue now. It is often used with words like for and since.
- Malik has lived in Benghazi for ten years.
Use the present perfect simple to talk about events that took place in a time that hasn’t finished. It is often used with words like this year and today.
- I haven’t seen Isam this morning.
Use the past simple to talk about events that started and finished in the past. It is often used with words like last week and an hour ago.
- They left for Egypt last Tuesday.

• Past perfect (WB page 82)
Form
- Affirmative: Had + past participle
  Example: We stayed in a hotel where we had stayed before.
- Negative: Had not (hadn’t) + past participle
  Example: When it was time to go, I still hadn’t found my passport.
- Question: Had + subject + past participle
  Example: Had you travelled abroad before or was this your first trip?

Use
When you are talking about two events in the past, use the past perfect to talk about the event that happened first. Use the past simple to talk about the other event.
- We had to buy new clothes because the airline had lost our baggage.
- I was waiting in the check-in line when I realized I had forgotten my passport.
Use the past simple, not the past perfect, when retelling a series of events in order.
- We showed the agent our boarding passes and got on the aeroplane.
- I bought some postcards, then I went back to my hotel.

• Defining and non-defining relative clauses (WB page 88)
Relative clauses are clauses that give more information about a noun. They often begin with a relative pronoun such as who, that or which.
- I like hotels that have a swimming pool.
Defining relative clauses give information about the noun that is necessary to understand the sentence.
- The man who owns Safar Tours is on TV tonight. (There will be many men on TV tonight. The relative clause is necessary for us to understand which man is going to be on TV.)
- The boy whose book I borrowed is in my class. (The relative clause tells us which boy the speaker is talking about.)

The relative pronouns you can use in a defining relative clause are:
- who for people
- that and which for things
- where for places
- whose to show possession

Non-defining relative clauses give additional information about the noun, but are not necessary to help you understand the sentence. There are commas before and after non-defining relative clauses.
- Sami, who has never left the country, is going to England for his holiday. (The relative clause gives interesting information about Sami, but is not necessary for us to understand who Sami is.)
- The Sunbeam Hotel, which is very close to the beach, is the best hotel in town. (The relative clause gives us more information about the hotel, but the sentence would make sense without it.)

The relative pronouns you can use in non-defining relative clauses are the same as for defining relative clauses, except that you cannot use that.

• Prefixes and suffixes (WB page 135)
Prefixes and suffixes are letters that we add to the beginnings and ends of words to change their meanings. Here are some examples of common prefixes and suffixes:
Prefix   Meaning        Example
anti     against        antipollution
bi       two            bicycle

Checklist for Written Work

Planning your work
☐ Read the question carefully. Underline the important parts. Do you understand it? If it is not clear, then ask your teacher.
☐ Brainstorm as many ideas as you can of what you are going to write about. Write them down as a list or mind map.
☐ Look up any vocabulary that you are unsure of.
☐ Select the ideas you want to use and delete any that are not relevant. You don’t have to use everything.
☐ Put your ideas into a logical order and group ideas that go together in sections.
☐ If you can, find a model text and look at the style and layout. Are there any phrases or vocabulary that you can adapt for your own work? (Be careful not to copy chunks of the model text without changing it, though.)
☐ Think about who you are writing for and decide on the style and layout. For example, if you are writing a letter to a friend, the style will be different to a formal letter and the layout will be different to a story.

Writing and revising your work
☐ Use the ideas from your planning to write the first draft. Don’t worry too much about accuracy or choosing the right words.
☐ Remember to start a new paragraph every time you move on to a new idea or topic.
☐ Read through your first draft and check that you have answered the question correctly.
☐ Decide if you want to delete, change or add any more ideas.
☐ Decide whether you want to change the paragraphing or the order of the ideas.
☐ Check that you have linked your ideas using connecting words and phrases (e.g., first, next, then, etc.).
☐ Write a second draft more carefully and slowly. Make sure your writing is clear.

Editing your work
☐ Read through your work. Check you have answered the question correctly, every sentence is clear, the grammar is correct, you have used suitable vocabulary and linking words and that the spelling is correct. (Check with a dictionary.)
☐ Show your work to your family or a friend and see if they can help you edit it.
☐ Editing tip: You could try reading the text in reverse order, starting with the final sentence and working backwards to the first sentence. This will stop you being distracted by the content and allow you to focus on technical details.

النص المُستخرج من الصفحة : 
limit was 110, but I was driving much faster. The police officers had a radar gun, and they knew I was driving too fast. They pulled me over and gave me a speeding ticket. I was about to leave when one of the officers gave me a piece of paper. It was a photo from a newspaper that showed a five-car crash. It was terrible. The police officer told me it happened because someone was speeding. I realized that by driving too fast I could get hurt and hurt other people, too. So I decided never to speed again. If I want to go fast, I can go on a roller coaster!

Speaker 2: You can get a lot of information from a crime scene. Footprints can tell you what type of shoes a thief was wearing, how big his feet are, and even how tall he is. Sometimes we find fingerprints. A person can leave fingerprints if his hands are dirty. Then the fingerprints are easy to find. But people leave fingerprints even when their hands are clean. We can see them only after putting a special powder on them. Matching fingerprints used to be difficult. Now it’s much easier because computers can do a lot of the work.

Lesson 2
🎧 Track 5
Listen and answer the questions.

Question: Is being a policeman dangerous?
Answer: Sometimes. It can be dangerous when you have to arrest somebody or stop a fight. But it isn’t dangerous all the time. When you are trying to find drivers who are speeding it can even be a bit boring, because you spend a lot of time waiting. One of the most important qualities a policeman must have is patience.

Question: Do you have to work at night?
Answer: There are always officers at the station to help people at any time of the day or night. But we don’t have to work every night. We usually take turns so we can spend some time at home with our family and friends.

Question: What do you like best about being a policeman?
Answer: Well, I like solving crimes. It can be very interesting. Sometimes it’s a bit like solving a puzzle. I also like the feeling that I’m helping people. If people don’t obey the law, others can get hurt. So when I arrest a criminal or stop a driver from speeding, I know that I’m making our city a better place to live.

Malek: What does that mean?  
Father: It means you should always have your baggage with you. If you don’t, someone from security might think it has something dangerous in it and take it away.  
Malek: Oh, no!

Malek: I think that’s my bag!

Mr Hazem: We need someone who is very reliable and can come to work on time every day. Work starts at 6 a.m. You may need to work some weekends, but not at night.
Samir: That’s fine. I like getting up early.
Mr Hazem: Good. Our security guards also need to be very fit. There are security cameras in the building, but you’ll have to walk around the building every hour, and it can be a bit tiring. When you’re not walking around the building, you’ll have to watch television screens that show what is happening in different areas.
Samir: Will I have to arrest people?
Mr Hazem: No! If you see anything unusual, you’ll call the police.
Samir: Oh, good.
Mr Hazem: You also must be very friendly and like talking to people, especially if you work in a mall or an office building. A lot of people go to those buildings, and many of them will ask for information or directions.
Samir: That’s fine. I enjoy talking to people.
Mr Hazem: Then you should enjoy the job. One more thing: you need to be computer literate for this job because you need to write reports at the end of every day. Can you use a computer?
Samir: Yes, my father’s got a computer at home.
Mr Hazem: Well then, you shouldn’t have any difficulty using our computers. All right then, would you like to come in for an appointment?
Samir: Yes, I would. What is a good time?
Mr Hazem: How about tomorrow at 10.00?
Samir: That’s fine.
Mr Hazem: Do you have an email address?
Samir: Yes, I do.
Mr Hazem: Good, I’ll send you the directions by email. They’re very clear. You shouldn’t have any trouble finding us.

Cathy: Do you think that dream is ever going to come true?
Maryam: No, I don’t. It’s just a dream. My parents wouldn’t approve of it. They want me to train as a doctor.
Cathy: What if you refused?
Maryam: Are you joking? They’d be really upset if I refused.
Cathy: But it’s your dream.
Maryam: I know. But I could never be a successful pilot, anyway.
Cathy: What do you mean?
Maryam: If I was a pilot, nobody would fly with me.
Cathy: Why not?
Maryam: Because I’m a bit scared of heights!
Cathy: If I were you, I’d train as a doctor and have flying lessons in my free time.

Hello, my name’s Mustafa Ali and I’m a film director. I’m pretty successful and I really enjoy my job. But it wasn’t easy finding the right career. When I was young, I tried quite a few courses and jobs. Somehow, none of them were right for me.
My mother suggested I should train as a pilot. So I went to the flying academy, where I had to take a lot of tests. I failed the eye test and they told me I couldn’t become a pilot.
When I was 18, I started training to be a doctor. Halfway through my course, I realized that I was scared of blood. So I knew it wasn’t the right profession for me.
My father was an engineer. When I gave up medicine, he said I should become an engineer like him. One day, I went with him to see a dam that he was building. It was really high and I suddenly got dizzy. My legs felt weak and I nearly fell off the side of the dam. I realized then that I was scared of heights and I told my father I could never be a successful engineer.
Some months later, I joined the police force. One day, I had to chase a thief, but I couldn’t run fast enough. I just wasn’t fit enough. So I gave up being a policeman.
Later, I got a job as a tour guide. There were tourists from all over the world: Britain, France, Japan, China, Italy. I couldn’t communicate with most of them because I didn’t speak enough languages. So I wasn’t a very good tour guide and my boss asked me to leave.

Dear Ms Marquez,
I saw your job advertisement posted on jobrus.com on 23<sup>rd</sup> June for Laboratory Technicians and would like to apply.
As you will see from my attached CV, I left university a year ago with a degree in Biomedical Science. Since then I have been travelling and volunteering for a vaccination programme with Oxfam in West Africa. I am now keen to find a full-time job in a busy company that will give me opportunities for career development. I am very impressed with Pharmaceutical Engineering's reputation and I would like to be involved in drug development because I feel it is very valuable work.
I have considerable knowledge of using statistical software from my degree course, where I also attended some coding classes. When I was volunteering, we would often work very long hours in the evenings and at weekends. Our group was very effective under pressure. The team leader will be happy to confirm this.
Although I do not have any previous experience in a laboratory, I feel I have the personal qualities and skills that you are looking for. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Aya Osman

Listen to two brothers talking. Underline the items on the bank statement that they talk about.

Aziz: Hi, Rami. What are you doing?
Rami: I’m trying to understand something I got from my bank. I’m not sure what it is.
Aziz: Let me see. Oh, that’s your bank statement. This is a paper that you’ll get every month from your bank. It’s really important because it shows you how much money went in and came out of your account every month.
You should look at it carefully and check it to make sure there aren’t any mistakes.
Rami: Can you help me figure out what it all means?
Aziz: Sure. Look, to the left of the title ‘bank statement’ is the name of your bank. Then there’s information to identify the bank account. Your name is on the left. Your account number, which is an eight-digit number, appears on the top right. That’s straightforward, right?
Rami: Sure, that’s easy.
Aziz: A transaction is an activity in your account. So the second column is where the bank says what happened in your account during the month, if you wrote a cheque or deposited money, for example. The date when that transaction happened is on the left.
Rami: And what does ‘balance’ mean?
Aziz: The balance is the total that is left in your account after each transaction. The first entry, which says ‘opening balance’, shows the amount that was in your account at the beginning of the month.
Rami: And under that it says cheque number 001. That must be a cheque I wrote.
Aziz: Yes, and further down there are more cheques. See? Numbers 002, 003 and 004. You wrote a lot of cheques last month!
Rami: Yes. I remember number 001 was to my dentist. The others are on the same day. Those must be the day I went to the mall. I bought some CDs, some clothes and some computer games by cheque that day.
Aziz: Oh, can I see your games?
Rami: Sure, but can you help me with the rest first?
Aziz: Yes, well, cash withdrawal means you took money out of your account, probably at an ATM.
Rami: Yes, I did.

Lesson 2
Track 18
Listen to the conversation between the customer and a banker and tick the things they talk about.

Customer: Good morning. I’d like some information about opening an account.
Banker: Of course. What kind of account would you like to get?
Customer: Well, I’m not really sure. What kinds of accounts do you have?
Banker: Well, first of all, are you over 17?
Customer: Yes, I’m 18. Why?
Banker: Well, we have special accounts for people under 17. But if you’re 18, you have different accounts to choose from. If you get a savings account, you get an ATM card.
Customer: That sounds like a good account. Can I get a cheque book? I think I’ll need a cheque book to pay bills.
Banker: No. Cheque books aren’t provided with a savings account. But you get a free cheque book if you open a current account.
Customer: And can I get an ATM card, too? I want to be able to get cash easily.

Banker: Yes. The cards can be used at any ATM machine in the country. You can also make withdrawals all over the world if you need money while you’re travelling.
Customer: What do I need to do to open an account?
Banker: You need to have an identity card and to deposit 400 Libyan dinars. If you have less than 200 Libyan dinars in your account, we charge a fee of 50 Libyan dinars per month.
Customer: That’s a lot of money. I haven’t got a job. I’m a student, I’m starting university next autumn.
Banker: Oh, then you should get a University student account. You don’t have to maintain a minimum balance.
Customer: Do you have a branch near the university?
Banker: Yes, we do. It is being renovated, but it will open again next month.
Customer: That’s great. I think I’ll open a student account then.

Lesson 4

Listen to the conversations and match them to the pictures.

Conversation 1
Banker: Good morning. Can I help you?
Customer: Yes, I don’t know what to do. I’ve lost my handbag. My wallet, with all my money and bank cards, was in it.
Banker: Are you sure you’ve lost it? Couldn’t you have just left it at home?
Customer: No. I definitely had it when I was at the café. I was talking to my friend when we left and I think I left it on the table.
Banker: Did you go back to look for it?
Customer: Yes, it wasn’t there. If I hadn’t been in such a hurry, I wouldn’t have left it there!
Banker: Don’t worry. If we cancel your cards now, no one else will be able to use them. New ones will be sent to you very soon.

Conversation 2
Customer: Do you take credit cards?
Cashier: I’m sorry, we don’t.
Customer: Can I pay by cheque?
Cashier: No, we only take cash.
Customer: I didn’t know that.
Cashier: Look, it’s on the sign.
Customer: Oh, no. If I’d known that, I would have brought cash.
Cashier: Well, if you go to the bank in the next street, you could get cash from the ATM.
Customer: Thank you very much.

Conversation 3
Waiter: I’m sorry, sir. Your credit card isn’t working.
Customer: Could you try it again, please? It worked yesterday.
Waiter: I’m sorry, it still isn’t working. Sometimes if you put in the wrong number several times, it gets blocked. Or you may have reached your credit limit. Would you like to pay by cheque instead?
Customer: Yes, that’s a good idea.

Conversation 4
Customer: Good morning. Can you help me? My bank card didn’t come out of the ATM.
Banker: Of course. Can you give me your account number? I’ll check your account.
Customer: Yes, it’s 92671098. Does this mean there’s no money in my account?
Banker: No. If there was no money in your account, the machine would still give you your card back. I see the problem. Your card has expired.
Customer: It has?
Banker: Yes. Today is 5 April and your card was valid until 4 April. We sent you a new card two weeks ago.
Customer: I never received it.
Banker: We’ll cancel that one and send you a new one, then. You should receive it in three or four days.

Track 20
Read and listen to the conversation.
Ahlam: Wow! Is that your car?
Nour: Yes! Nice, isn’t it? I bought it yesterday. Do you want to go for a drive? We could go to the beach.
Ahlam: Sure, that’s a great idea. I’d love a car like this one. How did you pay for it?
Nour: I got a car loan.
Ahlam: That’s a good idea. Maybe I should do that. If I got a car loan, would I have to make a big down payment?
Nour: No. I didn’t pay any money in advance at all. I just have to pay a certain amount every month.
Ahlam: That’s even better! But the monthly instalments must be pretty high. What are they?
Nour: About 800 Libyan dinars. It wasn’t that expensive, because it isn’t a new car.
Ahlam: It looks new!
Nour: The owner took really good care of it. It’s actually three years old.
Ahlam: How long do you have to pay it back?
Nour: Five years.
Ahlam: That’s a long time. Won’t it cost you a lot in interest?
Nour: Yeah. But it’s worth it. This sort of car is a real investment. It won’t lose money. In fact, it may even go up in value.
Ahlam: Well, I suppose it’s more enjoyable than investing your money in a business and waiting for it to make a profit! Maybe I should make an investment like this.
Nour: Here we are. The beach. Do you think I can fit into that parking space?
Ahlam: Sure. Uh, no, maybe not (sound of crash). Oh, no. I think one of your lights is broken.
Nour: Luckily, the loan also includes free car insurance!

Listen to a conversation between Hasan and his friend, Zaid.

Zaid: Hi, Hasan. I'm meeting Abdulla at 7.00 to watch the football game. Why don’t you come with us?
Hasan: Hi, Zaid. Thanks. I’d love to, but I’m afraid I can’t. At 7.00 I’ll be sitting in an English class, listening to my teacher!
Zaid: You’ll be at school? I thought you had a job.
Hasan: I do. But I’m also studying at a special language school to improve my English. Classes start at 6.00, so people can take them even if they work. It suits me perfectly.
Zaid: But your English is really good now.
Hasan: Not good enough. The company I work for needs people whose English is fluent so that they can go on business trips to other countries. I’m going to work on my English a lot this year. I’d really like the opportunity to travel with my job.
Zaid: It must take up a lot of your time.
Hasan: It does. I spend four hours a week in class, and when I get home I have to do a lot of homework.
Zaid: I couldn’t do that. When I get home from work I don’t want to do anything. I just want to relax!
Hasan: I know. It’s hard work and pretty tiring, but it’s worth it if my English improves. I’ll get a better job really quickly.
Zaid: Are the classes expensive?
Hasan: Well, yes. They cost 400 Libyan dinars. But the classes are fun. And speaking better English will help me when I’m on holiday in other countries. I’m actually quite enjoying studying again, too!

Lesson 4
🎧 Track 22
Listen to Nisrin talking about her summer class. Tick the reasons she liked her class.

Nisrin: I took a class in secretarial skills last summer, and I’m very glad I did. When I finished school in June, I just didn’t know what I wanted to do. I thought I’d study history and become a teacher, but I wanted time to think about it. I decided to get a job, so I enrolled in the class on secretarial skills. I enjoyed it a lot because I learnt so many new things. I knew a little about computers when I started, but in the class I learnt about all sorts of new programs, and I learnt to type much faster. The classes were never boring. Our teacher was great and explained everything very clearly. She was also very kind and sometimes stayed after class if someone had more questions. We usually did!

Another reason I liked the class is that we had very modern equipment, just like the equipment we would be using in our jobs. I liked the other students, too. The class was not too big, so we got to know each other quite well. Everybody was very motivated to learn, and we all helped each other. If one of us was going to be absent, she told the others so that we would make copies of the class notes for her. The best thing about the course is that it helped me find a job very quickly. I use all the skills I learnt on the course. Next, I think I’ll study business. Until then, I have a job as a secretary that I enjoy very much.

Lesson 6
Track 23
Listen to five people talking about their learning experiences.

1
I work for a large company that buys crafts in many countries throughout the world. Then we sell these products all over Great Britain. I worked as a secretary at the company for many years. I liked my job at first, but then I decided I wanted to have more responsibility. I knew a lot about the company and the products we buy, but I couldn't get a better job because I couldn't speak any other languages. Our company does a lot of business with the Middle East, so I decided I was going to learn Arabic. I found a language school that offered Arabic classes in the evening, and I went there twice a week after work. It took a long time, but it was great fun and really interesting, and now I have a more exciting job. I travel to the Middle East once a month and meet the craftsmen. My job is to help decide what products we buy.

2
I work for a company that makes and sells petroleum products. To make sure that our products are high-quality, we analyze them in our laboratory. When I started at the company, I was a laboratory technician and I helped the scientists by measuring the products and operating the machines. I was a good worker, so my employer said the company would give me on-the-job training. I learnt much more about laboratory procedures, and now I supervise a team of laboratory technicians.

3
Art was always my favourite class at school, but when I started my job at the bank I stopped drawing and painting. Then one day I had lunch with a friend who is a banker, too. I found out he was going to a painting class that evening. I went with him to see what it was like, and I enjoyed it so much I enrolled immediately. Now I go to my painting class once a week, and I also paint at home at weekends. It's really relaxing and who knows, I might sell some of them one day!

4
When I left school, I had trouble finding a job. My father said I should take a class in web design, but I didn't really want to. I knew the classes started in the summer, and I wanted to go on holiday with my friends. And I didn't know a lot about computers. I was more interested in fashion, and I thought the classes would be boring. But in the end, my father convinced me and I enrolled. I learnt a lot and I was surprised how much I enjoyed the class. Now I maintain the website of a famous clothing company and I love my job.

5
I worked for a removals company for a year. I liked the work, and I was very disappointed to learn the owner would be closing the company in the autumn, so I decided to start my own company. My friends didn't think it was a good idea. They said I would have to work harder than if I worked for somebody else. And they were right. It was very difficult at the beginning. I was tired and worried all the time. But it was worth it. My company is doing well now, and I am very proud of my work. I enjoy making all the decisions, and the best thing about running my own company is that I don't have to do what someone else tells me to do. I choose who I want to work with, too, so I get along with everybody.

The waste is then placed in different bags, one for food waste, another for glass, another for paper, and so on. These bags are then placed outside the house, where they are collected by the refuse lorry and taken to the waste treatment plant. At the waste treatment plant, all waste is separated into different types. Then it is carefully checked, and any waste which cannot be recycled is removed. The waste is then cleaned in special machines. Finally, it is taken to different factories, where it is treated. Products like glass, plastic and paper can all be used again.

Listen and check your answers.

Park ranger
I’ve been working as a park ranger for five years. I love this job because I love animals. I spend a lot of my working hours outdoors, collecting information about animals – where they are, what they are eating, if they are healthy. I also make sure that people respect the rules for protecting them. I don’t allow hunters in the park, and remind visitors not to leave rubbish that can hurt the wildlife.

Health, safety and environment manager
I work in a petrol refinery. I’m the health, safety and environment manager. Petrol is an important natural resource, but so are the air and water. There are lots of rules that we have to follow to make sure that our refinery doesn’t damage the environment. I also make sure that the people at the refinery work in safe conditions. It’s an important job, and I’m glad that I can help keep people safe.

Recycling coordinator
As the recycling coordinator for my city, I make sure that everybody understands the importance of recycling. I give talks to school groups and send people brochures with recycling information, such as which products to put in the different coloured recycling bins. When people realize that recycling helps keep the Earth clean for future generations, they usually want to participate in the recycling programme. I like to feel I’m making a difference in the quality of our environment by helping people reduce the amount of rubbish we put in landfill sites or incinerate.

Water quality planner
A water quality planner has an important job, because water is so important in our lives. We drink it, wash in it, cook with it and use it to help plants grow. That’s why our water must be as clean as possible. I am in charge of a team that collects water samples and makes sure that the water is clean. If there is a problem with the water, I help identify the reason and look for solutions.
